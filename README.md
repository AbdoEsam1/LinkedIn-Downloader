# LinkedIn-Downloader
LinkedIn DL  is a small GUI program coded with Python and based on my previous Lynda Download script.

LinkedIn GUI version is capable to download multiple courses from LinkedIn Learning by a given list. The features implemented in this beta version are:

<b>Completed:</b>
- Automatic Login to LinkedIn
- Enabling/Disabling Chrome extensions 
- Change Browser Agent
- Select Downloading Folder
- Add Courses List
- Working in Background and Windowed
- Option to save credentials from the browser, so after the first successful login if this option is selected the program will use the session.

<b>TODO Next:</b>
 - Proxy functionality and/or VPN
 - Improving the overall GUI look
 - Adding An Advanced Options Menu which will include specific sleep times to control the software behaviour more precisely
 - Capability to download Exercise Files (That was included in my LyndaDl script but not here)
 - Capability to download Transcripts 
 - Capability to separate the videos in chapters, so each chapter will have a particular folder with videos inside the course folder
 - Capability to choose the video quality before starting the program
 - Burning subtitles *in facts this functionality was implemented but I found difficulties to match the subtitles timings with the video precisely and had to remove it as became after all unreliable function. I am still looking to find a permanent solution.
 
 If you have any advice, recommending or ideas for additional functionalities they are very welcome. 
 
 Should you find any bugs or problems, please let me know so I can fix them accordingly.
