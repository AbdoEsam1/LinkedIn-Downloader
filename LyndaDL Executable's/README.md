# LyndaDL

LindaDL is based on https://github.com/r0oth3x49/lynda-dl but I have added an option to download list of courses specified in a text file using cookies and created executables to make your life easier. It separate the chapters and download subtitles.

I have provided a working cookie in the package, but it will expire at some point so you will have to add your own then.
