# LyndaDL

LindaDL is based on https://github.com/r0oth3x49/lynda-dl but I have added an option to download list of courses specified in a text file using cookies and created executables to make your life easier. It separate the chapters and download subtitles.

The whole Lynda/LinkedIn Learning courses database is added in the text file
I have provided a working cookie in the package, but it may expire at some point so you will have to add your own then.
